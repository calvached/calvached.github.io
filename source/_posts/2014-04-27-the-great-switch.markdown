Wooo! I finally got [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) up and running! Any new posts will be written here from now on. You can check out my old posts [here](http://yufinavstheworld.tumblr.com/).
I also found this nifty [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for Markdown!

_So what's this about a "Great Switch"?_
<!-- more -->
I caved and got a Mac. So I went back home for about two weeks and gave my brother my laptop for him to use in college. I took that as an opportunity to get a Mac this time around and try to avoid the hardships of making Windows play nicely with RoR. Although once I got back I realized that I forgot to merge the partition I made for Linux on my Windows system soo...it now has half as much hard drive space (oops, sorry bro!). 

I also then realized that gaming on a Mac looks like [this](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gaming-on-a-mac-meme.jpg) and I proceeded to react [appropriately](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wut.gif).

BUT THERE'S A PLUS SIDE! I now learned how to setup my environment on a MAC! 

Although there were a few bumps along the way. I mysteriously (and accidentally) "deleted" my .bash_profile in my /bin/bash shell so I had to switch to a different shell to fix it using [this](http://support.apple.com/kb/TA27005). I then had to open the .bash_profile and reset my PATH variable. After that was done I was back in business!

_So what was I doing that caused this situation?_ I was trying to setup Sublime to launch from the command line, but was unsuccessful. Time to try it again! 

**Current Status:** Stalking people's github profiles :3
