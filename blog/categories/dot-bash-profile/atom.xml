<p>Wooo! I finally got <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> up and running! Any new posts will be written here from now on. You can check out my old posts <a href="http://yufinavstheworld.tumblr.com/">here</a>.
I also found this nifty <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a> for Markdown!</p>

<p><em>So what&rsquo;s this about a &ldquo;Great Switch&rdquo;?</em></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I caved and got a Mac. So I went back home for about two weeks and gave my brother my laptop for him to use in college. I took that as an opportunity to get a Mac this time around and try to avoid the hardships of making Windows play nicely with RoR. Although once I got back I realized that I forgot to merge the partition I made for Linux on my Windows system soo&hellip;it now has half as much hard drive space (oops, sorry bro!).</p>

<p>I also then realized that gaming on a Mac looks like <a href="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/gaming-on-a-mac-meme.jpg">this</a> and I proceeded to react <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wut.gif">appropriately</a>.</p>

<p>BUT THERE&rsquo;S A PLUS SIDE! I now learned how to setup my environment on a MAC!</p>

<p>Although there were a few bumps along the way. I mysteriously (and accidentally) &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; my .bash_profile in my /bin/bash shell so I had to switch to a different shell to fix it using <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TA27005">this</a>. I then had to open the .bash_profile and reset my PATH variable. After that was done I was back in business!</p>

<p><em>So what was I doing that caused this situation?</em> I was trying to setup Sublime to launch from the command line, but was unsuccessful. Time to try it again!</p>
