        <p>This story was shared with me by my mentor, Kelly, a few days before I started my first day as an apprentice.</p>

<p><em>An apprenticeship is like two hikers in the woods&hellip;</em></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Imagine you are hiking down a forested trail with your apprentice. Imagine yourself walking beside the apprentice, not out in front. All of a sudden, you stop. Your apprentice stops with you. You both stand in silence. The apprentice is confused, wondering why you&rsquo;ve stopped. Then all of a sudden, a deer crashes out of the forest, onto the trail right in front of you, then scurries off the other direction.</p>

<p>After the deer is gone, you explain to your apprentice what you saw and heard that alerted you to the deer&rsquo;s presence. You show the footprints, the scat, and encourage the apprentice to keep an eye out.</p>

<p>Next imagine you come to a fork in the trail. You are familiar with these woods, you know that one trail leads you back home, and the other add 5 miles to your trip. A teacher would pull out a map, show the apprentice your current location, and show which trail to take. But you are not a teacher, you are a mentor. Instead you ask the apprentice to decide. &ldquo;Which way should we go?&rdquo; Then if the apprentice asks for a map, you provide the map. If the apprentice takes off down the longer path, you continue to walk along beside them.</p>

<p>Imagine your apprentice chose the long way. When you manage to get where you are going, you raise the question. &ldquo;I wonder where that other path went.&rdquo; Then you might pull out the map and show the apprentice how to read it. Not only will the apprentice have gained some knowledge, but they also have 5 extra mile of weariness where the lesson &ldquo;Check your map at every crossroads&rdquo; really sets in.</p>

<p>Through the entire day&rsquo;s hike, you&rsquo;ve kept the apprentice safe. You&rsquo;ve always know exactly where you were and how to get back home. You could at any moment, taken charge and avoided any danger.</p>
